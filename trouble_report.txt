zeds reluctant to jump from 2nd floor in main hall
bloat gets stuck in u2-023 (all zeds have trouble getting out)
trader pod does not visually deploy
zeds spawn in other end of building
only one tradera
scrake sometimes reluctant to walk through small doorways
shooting gallery corridors, spawns need teaking (shorter range)
jumping into middle open area fools zeds
